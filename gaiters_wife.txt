Create a Python application for a Word Scramble Game using the tkinter library. When the user clicks the "Play" button, the game should start and display a scrambled (jumbled) version of a randomly selected English word on the screen, with a countdown timer set to 2 minutes. The player should have an input field to type their answer and a "Submit" button to check if their answer is correct. When "Submit" is clicked, the application should verify if the entered word is a valid English word and an anagram of the scrambled word. If the word is correct, the game should update the score by adding 10 points, display a new scrambled word, and continue until the time runs out. If the word is incorrect, a "Try again" message should appear, allowing the player to attempt the same scrambled word again. After 2 minutes, the game should end automatically, and the application should display the total score based on all correct answers provided by the player during gameplay. Use appropriate Python libraries to handle letter scrambling and word verification.
