Here’s an assessment of Responses 1 and 2 based on the specified dimensions:

### Response 1

**Instruction Following**: **3 - No Issue**
- The response effectively meets the requirements of the prompt, providing a complete implementation for Gaussian elimination based on the equations provided. The output also aligns with the expected format, displaying the solutions correctly.

**Accuracy**: **3 - No Issue**
- The code is executable without errors, and the outputs generated are consistent with the expected mathematical results. Each function serves its intended purpose in the overall algorithm.

**Optimality and Efficiency**: **3 - No Issue**
- The code is organized and makes good use of functions, ensuring reusability. There’s no unnecessary repetition, and the structure is logical, following common practices in numerical computation.

**Presentation**: **3 - No Issue**
- The response is clear, well-organized, and properly documented. The use of comments to describe the purpose of each function contributes to the overall clarity of the code.

**Up-to-Date**: **2 - Up-To-Date**
- The code uses maintained libraries like NumPy and SymPy, which are current and widely used. However, the approach can be optimized further with more recent practices in numerical methods.

### Response 2

**Instruction Following**: **2 - Minor Issue**
- While the response does attempt to meet the prompt's requirements, there are minor issues that affect its adherence to the constraints, particularly in the back substitution implementation, which does not correctly reflect the expected behavior.

**Accuracy**: **2 - Minor Issue**
- The code contains a logic error in the back substitution function, leading to incorrect solutions. This affects the accuracy of the output, and the function's handling of the augmented matrix could be improved.

**Optimality and Efficiency**: **2 - Minor Issue**
- Although there are reusable functions, there are areas for optimization, particularly in the back substitution method, where the logic could be more concise. Some operations are repeated unnecessarily, which affects efficiency.

**Presentation**: **2 - Minor Issue**
- The response is mostly clear but lacks sufficient documentation for some functions, which could help improve understanding. More detailed comments would enhance the clarity of the code.

**Up-to-Date**: **2 - Up-To-Date**
- The response uses modern libraries like NumPy and SymPy effectively. However, similar to Response 1, there are some improvements to be made regarding best practices in implementation.

### Summary
- **Response 1** is well-executed, maintaining high standards across all dimensions, whereas **Response 2** exhibits minor issues, particularly in accuracy and clarity, that affect its overall quality. Addressing the noted areas of improvement would enhance the effectiveness of Response 2.
