Response 2 demonstrates a more thorough understanding of the requirements and delivers a functioning implementation, while Response 1's shortcomings in error handling and output presentation undermine its effectiveness.


### **Evaluation of Response 1**

#### **Instruction Following: 2/3**
- **Brief Explanation:** The response mostly follows the instructions: it creates a class that solves systems of linear equations using Gaussian elimination. However, there is a slight discrepancy in handling variables at the end, causing the program to break during variable printing due to an incorrect method (`split`) being applied to the `variables` (which is a tuple).

#### **Accuracy: 1/3**
- **Brief Explanation:** The response contains a critical bug that leads to an `AttributeError`. The issue lies in attempting to call `.split(' ')` on `variables`, which is a tuple returned by the `string_to_augmented_matrix` method. This bug prevents the solution from being correctly displayed.

#### **Optimality and Efficiency: 2/3**
- **Brief Explanation:** The code is logically structured, but there are inefficiencies in handling errors and performing operations like `get_index_first_non_zero_value_from_column`. While the Gaussian elimination process itself is correctly implemented, there are slight inefficiencies (e.g., non-reusable helper functions that could be optimized).

#### **Presentation: 2/3**
- **Brief Explanation:** The response is generally clear, but there is an issue with the output printing section that could confuse the user. Code comments and docstrings are present, explaining functions clearly. However, error handling could be improved.

#### **Up-to-Date: 3/3**
- **Brief Explanation:** The code uses current libraries like `NumPy` and `SymPy`, both of which are well-maintained and widely supported. There are no deprecated functions used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Evaluation of Response 2
**Instruction Following: 3/3**  
**Brief Explanation:** The response successfully implements a class that adheres to the provided requirements, effectively creating a Gaussian elimination solver that correctly processes input equations and derives the solution.

**Accuracy: 3/3**  
**Brief Explanation:** The code accurately implements the Gaussian elimination method, handling both the conversion of equations to matrices and the solution extraction correctly. The final output matches the expected values based on the given system of equations.

**Optimality and Efficiency: 2/3**  
**Brief Explanation:** The implementation is generally efficient and well-structured. However, certain methods, such as `get_index_first_non_zero_value_from_column` and `get_index_first_non_zero_value_from_row`, could benefit from improved readability and reusability. Additionally, there could be enhancements in error handling for edge cases (e.g., inconsistent or singular systems).

**Presentation: 3/3**  
**Brief Explanation:** The code is well-organized, with clear class and method documentation. The comments and docstrings provide a good understanding of each component's purpose. The output formatting is also clear and easy to read.

**Up-to-Date: 3/3**  
**Brief Explanation:** The code utilizes contemporary libraries like NumPy and SymPy, which are robust and well-supported. There are no deprecated functions or methods used, ensuring compatibility with current standards in Python programming.
