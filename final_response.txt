### Response 1

#### Instruction Following: **3/3**
**Reasoning**: The response thoroughly follows the instruction, providing code that implements Gaussian elimination and includes helper functions to manipulate matrices, find pivots, and perform back substitution. There are no major deviations from the task.

#### Accuracy: **2/3**
**Reasoning**: There is a minor issue in back substitution where the indexing logic for `index - 1` and `row_to_reduce` may result in incorrect row operations. However, the code mostly works as intended, and the approach is correct for the Gaussian elimination method.

#### Optimality and Efficiency: **2/3**
**Reasoning**: The response employs reusable functions, such as `swap_rows`, `get_index_first_non_zero_value`, and `augmented_matrix`. However, there are some redundancies, particularly in row operations and the handling of pivots. The code could be optimized by refining the logic for swapping rows and determining pivot candidates.

#### Presentation: **3/3**
**Reasoning**: The code is well-organized and includes a logical progression of steps, from matrix setup to Gaussian elimination and back substitution. The variable names are clear, and the code is easy to read. 

#### Up-to-Date: **2/2**
**Reasoning**: The code uses up-to-date libraries like NumPy and SymPy, which are actively maintained. No deprecated or out-of-date libraries are used.

### Response 2

#### Instruction Following: **3/3**
**Reasoning**: Like Response 1, Response 2 follows the prompt's instructions closely, providing a complete solution for Gaussian elimination with helper functions for row swaps and pivoting.

#### Accuracy: **3/3**
**Reasoning**: Response 2 fixes the issue from Response 1 by improving the back substitution logic. The row operations and pivot handling are correct, making this code executable without logical errors.

#### Optimality and Efficiency: **3/3**
**Reasoning**: This response improves on Response 1 by reducing some redundancies and making more efficient use of functions. The approach to Gaussian elimination and back substitution is optimized compared to the first response, especially in handling row operations.

#### Presentation: **3/3**
**Reasoning**: Like Response 1, this response is well-presented, with clear organization and naming conventions. The code flow is logical and easy to follow.

#### Up-to-Date: **2/2**
**Reasoning**: The response uses modern, well-maintained libraries like NumPy and SymPy, ensuring it is up-to-date.
